# Project Overview

## Project Name

What Do I Consume?

## Project Description

My project is a tracker of your media habits. How many books did you read this year and what was your most popular genre of books? Forget what that tv show you watched 4 months ago and loved was called? The What Do I Consume app will track all of this. You can add entries for all these different types of media that you have consumed and also add to a list of to-read/to-watch/to-listen to keep track of what you still want to look at.

## API and Data Sample
I will be using Airtable to store information on the books, tv shows, movies, etc. that people have watched/read/listened to. This data will then be rendered on another page.


### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Create clickable buttons for user to add a book, movie, tv show, etc.
- Create ability for user to review each of these individually and for this data to render to a second page
- Allow user to navigate between pages 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

-Create a to-read/watch list
-Add images from APIs of the books/movies that will display
-Use animations somehow?

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: Pretty excited about my project and have a pretty good understanding of the features I want to include.

### Weaknesses: Time Management, general feeling of uncertainty of understanding from the unit.

### Opportunities: Have a lot of learning/growth in terms of learning React as a whole and components. Excited to get more familiar with this! 

### Threats: Will need to stay focused, reach out for help when needed, and
